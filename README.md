# Forum for Everyone!

>This is a joint project by **Michael Cen**, **Bill Que** and **William Cheng** on the topic of Object Oriented Programming.

**The forum project is designed as an inclusive forum platform**. In this forum, **everyone** can sign up as a user, and users can post **anything** and view everyone elseâ€™s posts. In addition, users will have full control over their ideas: they can view and delete their posts as they wish. Meanwhile, moderators(the administrator of the forum) will have the capability to manage all the posts: they can view and delete any post on the forum. The main goals of this project are to facilitate community engagement, allow users to share information and ideas, and enable moderators to maintain the quality and appropriateness of the content. The project aims to create a user-friendly, efficient, and secure environment for users. Users can share any of their thoughts and ideas on the forum; meanwhile, any post deemed unfit for the community could be promptly removed from the forum by the moderator.
